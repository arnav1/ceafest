											<p>Concrete is as we know the heart of modern day construction. For a commoner, civil engineering means concrete. Its unique features make it the best choice as a material. However, blessed with such a role in construction, some of these features and basic properties have to be modified to face challenges such as strength, weight to name a few.</p>
											
											<p>Using trending and new technologies like light weight concrete to testing parameters like sound and shock absorption, the competition has always been offering participants a chance to explore and learn more of concrete technology making it the most participated event in CEA Fest.</p>

										<div class="tab-pane" id="tab15">
											<p>Concrete challenge returns this year with a problem statement that demands participants to build a mix which can deal with requirements ranging from complexity of moulds or Compactness to Aesthetics, Durability and surface Finishing. Achieving this through thorough research is the ‘challenge’ Concrete Challenge has to offer you.</p>
											<p>Light weight concrete (LWC) is the prime focus of this year’s problem statement. Participant team has to prepare a standard 10cmX10cmX10cm cube out of concrete. The cube will be tested on 3 aspects which are the mass (weight), the compressive strength and the cost of manufacture. Detailed problem statement will be posted soon.</p>

If so, come and be a part of the CEA Debate, an event that brings together students from across India to gather their thoughts, re-interpret facts and kindle thought on a wide variety of issues and problems concerning Civil Engineering and its practice around the world.</p>
											
											<p>Battle out your differences in teams of two against students from various institutes on trending topics, with professors presiding over as judges. After all, "Time spent arguing is, oddly enough, almost never wasted".</p>
