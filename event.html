				<p>You can’t build a great building on a weak foundation. </p>
				You must have a solid foundation if you are going to have a strong superstructure.
<p>  Foundation is the base of any structure. Without a firm foundation, the structure cannot stand. The strength of the foundation determines the life of structure. The design of foundation depends on soil and load. There has been a surge of infrastructural development in India during the last few years. High rise buildings have become nations’ symbol of pride and development. The foundation design is what matters. Hence it is a big challenge for us civil engineers to design a foundation for a high rise building in Indian conditions. </p>
									</div>																																			
				
									<div class="tab-pane" id="tab89">
				<p>The participants are required to design a foundation for a high rise building, ensuring that it can stand the test of time. </p>
				<p>It should be noted that the foundation design should not only bear the load of the building but also be cost efficient. </p>
				<p>The participating teams should make a presentation giving their analysis, approach and factors considered in designing the foundation, along with the technical details of the foundation. The participants are required to devise innovative techniques to build the foundation of a building with given specifications.</p>

										<p>	Concrete is as we know the heart of modern day construction. For a commoner, civil engineering means concrete. Its unique features make it the best choice as a material. Many people think all concrete is the same. This is not true! Concrete is no longer a simple grey mass, but it has made its way to become pervious (lighter with honey comb structures), more beautiful (architectural concrete), colored, stronger (high strength concrete), self-compacting to name a few. </p>

										<p>	Today in India, we see that in cities, storm-water runoff is a big challenge during monsoon. Storm water runoff increases both erosion and flooding influencing both water quality and quantity problems. A simple solution to avoiding these problems is to stop installing the impervious surfaces that block natural water infiltration into the soil. Rather than building them with conventional concrete or asphalt, more and more communities, municipalities, and businesses are switching to pervious concrete or porous pavement, a material that offers the inherent durability and low life-cycle costs of a typical concrete pavement while retaining storm water runoff and replenishing local watershed systems. Already one of the most happening topics in Research & Development, pervious concrete is rapidly gaining popularity in the industrial sector as well. CEA Fest’s Concrete Challenge offers the right platform to solve this problem from this aspect.  </p>

										</div>
										<div class="tab-pane" id="tab15">
										
											<p>Concrete challenge returns this year with a problem statement that demands participants to design such pervious concrete mix which satisfies required strength and permeability requirements as well as is lightweight because of the abundance of pores. Achieving this through thorough research and presenting it to win the judges over is the ‘challenge’ Concrete Challenge has to offer you.</p>
											<p>To make two 100x150 mm (diameter 100mm, length 150mm) pervious concrete cylinders having
	<ul>
	<li>High permeability
	<li>Good compressive strength
	<li>Minimal Density
	</ul>
Both the cylinders should be made out of same material and should satisfy all above conditions. The cylinders should be cast 7 days prior to the event.

<li><b>Testing (Weightage 80%) (Score1)</b>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Permeability</b>: Permeability will be tested using standard equipment. It will be measured in cm/s (centimeters/second). </li>
	<li><b>Dimension Validity</b>: The dimensions of the cylinder should be (10cm X 15cm).Maximum error of 5mm is allowed. </li>
	<li><b>Strength</b>: The measurement of compressive strength will be mechanized.</li>
	<li><b>Density</b>: Density will be calculated after calculating the mass and volume (will be measured with vernier calipers). </li>

	<br>
	<b>Marking Scheme:</b>
	If P is the permeability in cm/s, S is the compressive strength in MPa and D is the density in kg/m3 then, Score1 = [{40x(P/Pmax)} + {30x(S/Smax)} + {10x(Dmin/D)}]where, <br>
	Pmax is the <b>maximum permeability</b> obtained among all participating teams, <br>
        Smax is the <b>maximum compressive strength</b> obtained among all participating teams <br>
        and Dmin is the <b>minimum density</b> obtained among all participating teams.

<li><b>Poster Presentation (Weightage 10%) (Score2)</b>	
						<p>The team has to prepare an A3 size poster with details such as details regarding the mix design and related research done by them and present it to the judges. The poster will be judged on basis of the content, presentation skills and the poster design. This will be
